    <h3 id="Dana">About the Creator, Dana Terrace</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/DanaTerrace">Dana Terrace</a> previously worked on other popular
      Disney animated series. She was as a storyboard artist for
      <em>Gravity Falls (2012-2016)</em> and director of the <em>DuckTales (2017-2021)</em> reboot.
      <em>Gravity Falls'</em> creator, <a href="#King">Alex Hirsch</a> also voices some characters
      in The Owl House. In an interview with CBR, Terrace explains the inspiration behind the
      series:
    </p>

    <article>
      <blockquote>
        I rediscovered the works of Hieronymus Bosch, Remedios Varo, John Bauer and all these
        painters from between the 1500s to the 1800s that I just really admired and loved. I love
        medieval illuminations, and the little monsters in the corners. And I basically just
        thought, "I'd be cool if there was a cartoon like this." And I started doodling.

    <h3>Why Did The Owl House Get Cancelled By Disney?</h3>
    <p>
      Even though the series was well received by audiences and quickly grew a large fan-base,
      Disney cancelled the series after season 2. Many fans were upset by this cancellation and
      speculated that is was because the series has prominent LGBTQ+ representation as

      one of those guys decided <abbr title="The Owl House">TOH</abbr> didn't fit that "brand".</q
    >

    <p>
      The series was able to conclude its storyline, however the third and final season was cut
      short. Instead of having the regular 20 episode season, similar to the first two seasons,
      season 3 was reduced to three specials, each 44 minutes long.
