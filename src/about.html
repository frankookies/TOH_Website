    <h1>About The Author</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Francesca Ysabelle Galang. I am a Seneca Polytechnic Computer Programming and
      Analysis Student. For my WEB222 class, I have created a educational/informational website
      about one of my favourite Television Shows, <em>The Owl House</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After researching online about <em>The Owl House</em>, I compiled my findings by writing a
      research summary. I used HTML5 markup to create this website and including a "class-less"
      CSS-stylesheet from
      <a href="https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/"
        >https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/</a
      >. I used the <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">Water.css</a> stylesheet for this
      website.
    </p>

    <p>
      My website is about <em>The Owl House</em> because it is one of my favourite tv shows. I
      watched it with my brother and we both enjoyed watching it together. This show combines a lot
      of my interests into one really fun show! It has elements of magic, exciting world building,
      fantasy, comedy, drama, romance, friendship, and relatable characters. I loved going on the
      journey with Luz, the main character, as she discovers the fantastical world of "The Boiling
      Isles" and finally finds friends and a place where she feels like she truly belongs.
